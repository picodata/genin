## About
Genin is an inventory generator for `Ansible Cartridge`. It provides a command-line
tool that allows quick inventory creation for clusters of any size.
For example, an inventory file for a cluster of 50 replicasets can easily be of thousand
lines or more. Any slight change of the configuration, eg. adding a new configuration
option for all storages, means a lot of manual routine and increases the risk of
improper or incomplete configuration. Genin  allows you to stay confident while
maintaining the configuration file and steer clear of inaccuracies and human errors.
Genin is the tool that will help you very quickly roll out cluster configuration updates.

unzip.exe genin-0.5.4-windows-amd64.zip -d %HOME%/.cargo/bin/
```
> **Note:** The application can then be found under the `.cargo/bin` folder inside
> your user profile folder. Make sure it is in your `%PATH%`.

Ð¡heck that the installation was successful:
```
genin --version
```

## Usage guide

### Inventory generation

First, let's generate a simple cluster for the `Vagrant` virtual environment.
For that `Genin` will need a `yaml` file with a concise list of cluster
details. That is a minimal cluster configuration file that features `Genin's`
own formatting. As long as users will likely need to have a descriptive
template of that file, `Genin` can automatically generate it with a built-in
dedicated subcommand:

```shell
genin init
```
This will result in creating the `cluster.genin.yaml` file in the current
directory.

> **Note:** If the `cluster.genin.yml` file already exists in current
> directory, then the new file will be named `cluster.genin.copy.yaml`.
> The `genin init` command will always append the `.copy` suffix to the
> file's name if the expected file exists.

Also, you can explicitly set the configuration file name:

```shell
genin init --output mycluster.yml
```
> **Note:** Use the `--output` flag together with the full path to
> `mycluster.yml` to specify the directory where the final cluster
> files will be saved.

Now you can open the file and examine the syntax.

```yaml

# list of replicasets as an array
topology:
  # List of replicasets as an array of arrays, where each element is a replicaset with a replica set
  - name: router              # (mandatory) replicaset name
    replicasets_count: 1      # (optional) how many masters we want, by default equal 1
    replication_factor: 0     # (optional) number of replicas in replicaset, default for router 0
    weight: 10                # (optional) replicaset weight
    zone:                     # (optional) zone parameter for ansible cartridge playbook
    roles:                    # (optional) list of roles
      - router
      - api
      - failover-coordinator
    config:                     # (optional) config with arbitrary key-values pairs
      replicaset_name: router   # any other configuration parameters in free order

  # all another replicasets generated using the init subcommand will have the same set of parameters
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 2        # this means 2 replicasets
    replication_factor: 3       # with 3 replicas in each replicaset
    weight: 10
    roles:
      - storage
    config:
      vshard_group: storage   # (optional) vshard group for vshard-storage
      all_rw: true            # (optional) all replicas can write data
      zone: tokio             # (optional) zone for ansible cartridge

# map of regions, datacenters, and hosts
hosts:
  - name: cloud           # (mandatory) hostname or domain name
                          # in this example, both hosts are in the same cloud data center
    config:               # (optional) begin binary and http port, by default 8081, 3031
                          # ports can be defined on all levels
      http_port: 8081          # (optional) http port to start counting from
      binary_port: 3031        # (optional) binary port to start counting from
    hosts:
      - name: host-1      # (mandatory) hostname or domain name
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.11  # address can be IP, url, subnet (subnet allowed only for higher levels)
      - name: host-2
        config:
          address: host-1.cloud.com

# failover parameters
failover:
  mode: stateful                      # (optional) failover mode (stateful, eventual, disabled)
  state_provider: stateboard          # (optional) what is serve failover (stateboard, stateful)
  stateboard_params:                  # (optional) params for chosen in state_provider failover type
      uri: 192.168.16.1:4401
      password: "vG?-GG!4sxV8q5:f"

# vars similar to those configured in the TDG inventory
vars:
  ansible_user: my_user
  ansible_password: my_user_password
  cartridge_app_name: my_app
  cartridge_package_path: /tmp/my_app.rpm
  cartridge_cluster_cookie: my_app_cluster_cookie
  # put here you personally key/value ansible cartridge vars
```

Replace the stubs with the actual values of your hosts and their parameters
and save the file.

So far you are already halfway through getting things done! Use the resulted
`Genin` configuration file to generate the final inventory file. Here is the
required command for that:

```shell
genin build
```

Done! The `inventory.yaml` file will appear in the same directory where you
launched `Genin`. Now we can set up the cluster:

```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml playbook.yaml
```

---

### Editing the cluster configuration

---

#### Minimal configuration

The initial cluster configuration file can be slimmed down to the following
minimal variant:

```yaml
---
topology:
  - name: router            # since replicasets_count is not set for this replicaset,
                            # and also no roles are set, then Genin will automatically determine it by name as
                            # router and set the number of replicas in the replication set to 1 (replication count: 1)
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 3
    replication_factor: 2

hosts:
  - name: cloud
    config:
      address: 192.168.12/32
    hosts:
      - name: host-1        # ip 192.168.16.12 will be automatically allocated from the above subnet
      - name: host-2        # ip 192.168.16.13 will be automatically allocated from the above subnet
```

This is a perfectly valid and working configuration file. The rest of the
parameters wil use their default values.

A set of examples can be found in the directory [docs/examples](docs/examples).

---

#### Changing the Topology

---

Now let's change the file, and expand our cluster to make the inventory more
similar to the real one. To do this, we will increase the number of routers of
hosts, routers, stacks up to 10. Change the number of storage replicas to 1,
and add a custom replicaset `cache` in the amount of 5 pieces.

```yaml
---
topology:
  - name: router
    replication_factor: 10    # this replicaset has no roles defined and its name is a router,
                              # so the replicasets_count parameter will be ignored
                              # and the default number of replicasets will be set to 1
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 10     # since the number of replicases in replicaset is not set,
                              # the default will be 10 replicasets with 1 replica in each

hosts:
  - name: cloud
    hosts:
      - name: host-1
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.11      # in this example, the address for each host is set separately,
                                      # but for convenience, the address could be set by subnet,
                                      # specifying it one level higher for cloud
      - name: host-2
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.12
      - name: host-3
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.13
      - name: host-4
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.14
      - name: host-5
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.15
      - name: host-6
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.16
      - name: host-7
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.17
      - name: host-8
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.18
      - name: host-9
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.19
      - name: host-10
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.20
```
The actual difference between the 2 replicasets configuration and a large
cluster configuration is not that great, whereas the resulting inventory file
for the large cluster will be 5 times bigger.

---

#### Redefining failover

---

Until now, our cluster has always been with `stateful failover` , now let's
change it to `disabled` and run the generation with the command:

```shell
genin build --failover-state-provider etcd2
```
> **Note:** All options have a short version, for example for provider
> failover is `genin build -F etcd2`

This flag will override the failover type we specified in `cluster.genin.yaml`,
and add default values based on those recommended for `etcd2`.

The options related to failover and other subcommands work in the same way.
```shell
genin init --failover-mode disabled
```
`disabled` argument for `failover-mode` and `failover-state-provider` disable
failover.

You can learn more about the operation of the failover and the possible options
in the documentation. [Tarantool documentation](https://www.tarantool.io/ru/doc/1.10/book/cartridge/topics/failover/).

---

#### Balancing and distribution control

By default, `Genin` always allocates instances based on the current host load.
For example the following configuration for Genin would be distributed in
the following way:

```yaml
---
topology:
  - name: router
    replicasets_count: 4
    roles:
      - router
      - failover-coordinator
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 2
    replication_factor: 4
    roles:
      - storage
  - name: cache
    replicasets_count: 2
    roles:
      - cache
hosts:
  - name: dc-1
    hosts:
      - name: server-1
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.11
      - name: server-2
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.12
  - name: dc-2
    hosts:
      - name: server-3
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.13
      - name: server-4
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.14
...
```

![default-spreading](docs/images/default-spreading.gif)

Although for most automatic distribution clusters `Genin` should be enough,
there can always be a situation where some replicasets must be allocated to
a specific host or group of hosts. For this there is a special option
`failure_domains` in the `Genin` configuration.

```yaml
---
topology:
  - name: router
    replicasets_count: 4
    roles:
      - router
      - failover-coordinator
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 2
    replication_factor: 4
    roles:
      - storage
  - name: cache
    replicasets_count: 2
    failure_domains: [dc-2]
    roles:
      - cache
hosts:
  - name: dc-1
    hosts:
      - name: server-1
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.11
      - name: server-2
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.12
  - name: dc-2
    hosts:
      - name: server-3
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.13
      - name: server-4
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.14
...
```
This will cause Genin to allocate the cache replicaset as follows:

![failure-domains-1](docs/images/failure-domains-1.gif)

If you specify several host names in `failure_domains` at once
`[ server-2, server-3 ]`, then `cache` replicaset instances are guaranteed
will be on the specified hosts.

![failure-domains-2](docs/images/failure-domains-2.gif)

---
#### Use failure domain name as a zone for the instance config

You can also use a failure domain name as a value for the [`zone`](https://github.com/tarantool/ansible-cartridge/blob/master/doc/variables.md?plain=1#L90) property of the instances config. Just add the `--fd-as-zone` flag to your `build` command, for example: `genin build --fd-as-zone`.

With this flag, once the instances are distributed over the target hosts according to the failure_domains algorithm, the final host name of each instance becomes its zone parameter and gets stored in the instance's config.

---

### Reverse parsing config

Since `Genin` is a relatively new tool, and `picodata` is far from full
`tarantool` clusters were generated with it, then to simplify transition
there is a `reverse` command.

```shell
genin reverse -s inventory.yml -o cluster.genin.yml
```

This command allows you to parse the already finished inventory and get the
configuration `cluster.genin.yml` for `genin build`. Why might this be needed?
For example for the `upgrade` command. which serves to add new replicasets or
instances and requires 2 configuration files.

The `reverse` command has several important features:
1. Since the inventory is a flat list, without division by domains, data
centers, regions, then `genin` cannot know anything about the structure and
will generate a flat configuration too.

For example, if we go through a loop, then we will lose all information about
`failure` domains:
```shell
genin init -o cluster.genin.yml
genin build -s cluster.genin.yml -o inventory.yml
genin reverse -o inventory.yml
```

The last command, the `reserve` call, will display the table without domains.
```text
+-------------+-------------+
|          cluster          |
+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |
+-------------+-------------+
| router-1-1  | storage-1-1 |
| 8081 8081   | 8081 8081   |
+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-2 | storage-2-1 |
| 8082 8082   | 8082 8082   |
+-------------+-------------+
| storage-2-2 |             |
| 8083 8083   |             |
+-------------+-------------+
```

2. The configuration file received in using `reverse` will also have
slightly different configuration.

```yaml
---
topology:
  - name: router
    replicasets_count: 1
    replication_factor: 1
    roles:
      - router
      - failover-coordinator
    config:
      http_port: 8081
      binary_port: 8081
      address: 192.168.16.11
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 2
    replication_factor: 2
    roles:
      - storage
    config:
      http_port: 8082
      binary_port: 8082
      address: 192.168.16.11
hosts:
  - name: server-1
    config:
      address: 192.168.16.11
  - name: server-2
    config:
      address: 192.168.16.12
failover:
  mode: stateful
  state_provider: stateboard
  stateboard_params:
    uri: "192.168.16.11:4401"
    password: password
vars:
  ansible_user: ansible
  ansible_password: ansible
  cartridge_app_name: myapp
  cartridge_cluster_cookie: myapp-cookie
  cartridge_package_path: /tmp/myapp.rpm
  cartridge_bootstrap_vshard: true
```

#### Cluster reconfiguration

To update a deployed cluster using the generated `Genin` inventory, there is
a special `upgrade` command for adding new instances. Unlike inventory
regeneration, when which all instances are redistributed each time anew,
`upgrade` will leave distribution as is, and will only add new instances.
This will allow painlessly upgrade the cluster, without a full redeploy.

To run `upgrade` you need to pass two required arguments `--old`
and `--new`.
```shell
genin upgrade --old cluster.genin.yml --new upgrade.genin.yml -o inventory.yml
```

The `--old` option specifies the path to the old cluster config we want
to do an `upgrade`.
Option `--new` path to new cluster configuration based on which `Genin`
will make `diff` and add those instances that were not in the config passed to
`--old`.

### Flags and options

Here we describe few other useful flags and options that you might want to
use with `genin`.
First, you can always change paths of both source and target configuration
files using the `--source` (short `-s`) and `--output` (short `-o`) flags
respectively. We recommend using the `.genin.` suffix for naming convenience.
Here is the example command in two variants:
```shell
genin init --output /home/tarantool/custom_cluster_name.yml
genin show --source /home/tarantool/custom_cluster_name.yml
genin build --source /home/user/path/my_cluster.genin.yml --output /home/tarantool/cluster-new/my_hosts.yml
genin build -s /home/user/path/my_cluster.genin.yml -o /home/tarantool/cluster-new/my_hosts.yml
```
> **Note:** It is worth reiterating that if any of the subcommands
> `build`, `init` etc. `Genin` will look for files with default names
> (such as cluster.genin.yaml, inventory.yaml)

Next, there is a very useful option for controlling the log output. There
are three supported log levels that you can enable using the `-v` flag with
a desired number of extra `v` letters for more verbosity (up to`-vvv`).
Single `v` means *INFO*, double means *DEBUG*, and three or more mean *TRACE*.
```
genin build -vvv
```

---

> **Note** The number of displayed information increases with the addition of new
> occurrences of `-v`. For example `-vv` will be equivalent to *TRACE* level

---

There is an option `--scheme` to control how the schema is displayed (short
option -p) which accepts a sequence of equivalent characters display options.

// Character table under development

In addition, flags exist to convey sensitive information.

```shell
genin build --ansible-user dmitry.travyan --ansible-password ddfqd
genin build --cartridge-cluster-cookie R68sJfV4C2hLrWC3
```

As mentioned earlier, by default, `Genin` will create copies of files if
The target file already exists in the specified path. In order to force
overwrite the target file use the `--force` flag (or `-f`).
```shell
genin build -o my-cluster.yml
genin build -o my-cluster.yml --force
```

The `--export-state` argument can be useful to export [state](#Genin-state) into a
separate file.
```shell
genin build -s cluster.genin.yml --export-state my-state.gz
```

The `quiet` option can be useful if you want to disable the cluster display in
the console.
```shell
genin init --quiet
genin build --quiet -s cluster.genin.yml
genin upgrade --quiet --old cluster.genin.yml --new cluster-new.genin.yml
```

For specific use cases with idiomatic distribution the dedicated
`--idiomatic-merge` option can be used. Without it, `genin` considers
replicasets to be equivalent if they contain the same name. For example,
`api-1` and `api-1-1` will be considered replicas of the same
replicaset. The aforementioned option requires the replicas' names to
match exactly, otherwise they will never be merged in one replicaset.
```shell
genin upgrade --old cluster-old.genin.yml --new cluster-new.genin.yml

### Genin upgrade

`Genin` supports the `upgrade` command from the early days. The command allows
generating inventories based on two different cluster configurations. It has several
significant differences from the `build` command. For example, if we take the initial
configuration with 4 servers in 2 data centers, double the number of servers, and add
several new replicas, `genin build` will generate a standard distribution:
```shell
genin build --source cluster-old.genin.yml

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                        cluster                        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|        datacenter-1       |        datacenter-2       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |  server-3   |  server-4   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  router-1   |  router-2   |  router-3   |  router-4   |
|  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-1 | storage-1-2 | storage-1-3 | storage-1-4 |
| 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
```

```shell
genin build --source cluster-new.genin.yml

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                        cluster                        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|        datacenter-1       |        datacenter-2       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |  server-3   |  server-4   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  router-1   |  router-2   |  router-3   |  router-4   |
|  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-1 | storage-1-2 | storage-1-3 | storage-1-4 |
| 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-2-1 | storage-2-2 | storage-2-3 | storage-2-4 |
| 8083/3033   | 8083/3033   | 8083/3033   | 8083/3033   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
```

In this case, any change in the configuration, for example, changing
ports, will completely overwrite starting ports of the original cluster.
Installing such inventory will completely break an already existing
cluster.
```shell
genin build --source cluster-old.genin.yml

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                        cluster                        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|        datacenter-1       |        datacenter-2       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |  server-3   |  server-4   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  router-1   |  router-2   |  router-3   |  router-4   |
|  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-1 | storage-1-2 | storage-1-3 | storage-1-4 |
| 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
```

```shell
genin build --source cluster-new.genin.yml

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                        cluster                        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|        datacenter-1       |        datacenter-2       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |  server-3   |  server-4   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  router-1   |  router-2   |  router-3   |  router-4   |
|  9081/5031  |  9081/5031  |  9081/5031  |  9081/5031  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-1 | storage-1-2 | storage-1-3 | storage-1-4 |
| 9082/5032   | 9082/5032   | 9082/5032   | 9082/5032   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-2-1 | storage-2-2 | storage-2-3 | storage-2-4 |
| 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
```

To circumvent this issue specifically for **upgrade** cases, let's use
the `genin upgrade` command instead.
> **Note:** `upgrade` is a sequential cluster change based on `--old`
>  source configuration and `--new` target configuration. The `--old`
> cluster instances are guaranteed to keep their ports/addresses and
> other parameters unchanged.

```shell
genin build --source cluster-old.genin.yml

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                        cluster                        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|        datacenter-1       |        datacenter-2       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |  server-3   |  server-4   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  router-1   |  router-2   |  router-3   |  router-4   |
|  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-1 | storage-1-2 | storage-1-3 | storage-1-4 |
| 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
```

```shell
genin upgrade --old cluster-old.genin.yml --new cluster-new.genin.yml

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                        cluster                        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|        datacenter-1       |        datacenter-2       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |  server-3   |  server-4   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  router-1   |  router-2   |  router-3   |  router-4   |
|  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-1 | storage-1-2 | storage-1-3 | storage-1-4 |
| 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-2-1 | storage-2-2 | storage-2-3 | storage-2-4 |
| 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
```

The resulting new inventory can be safely applied to a cluster that was
initially deployed using the previous inventory. All new instances will
have a new configuration, while the old ones will receive only those
parameters that can be changed without breaking the cluster.

### Genin state

When using `genin upgrade` we always get consistent changes in the cluster, but only within
one single upgrade. This is because the configuration clusters passed in the `--old` and `--new`
arguments are distributed in the same way as with `genin build`. That is, we first distribute the
configuration passed to `--old` and then over it passed to `--new`. This means that if we want to
`upgrade` again but already on top of the configuration passed to `--old` then this will be
equivalent to calling `genin build`.
```shell
genin upgrade --old cluster-old.genin.yml --new cluster-new.genin.yml

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                        cluster                        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|        datacenter-1       |        datacenter-2       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |  server-3   |  server-4   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  router-1   |  router-2   |  router-3   |  router-4   |
|  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |  8081/3031  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-1 | storage-1-2 | storage-1-3 | storage-1-4 |
| 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   | 8082/3032   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-2-1 | storage-2-2 | storage-2-3 | storage-2-4 |
| 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
```

```shell
genin upgrade --old cluster-new.genin.yml --new cluster-new-new.genin.yml

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                        cluster                        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|        datacenter-1       |        datacenter-2       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  server-1   |  server-2   |  server-3   |  server-4   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|  router-1   |  router-2   |  router-3   |  router-4   |
|  9081/5031  |  9081/5031  |  9081/5031  |  9081/5031  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-1-1 | storage-1-2 | storage-1-3 | storage-1-4 |
| 9082/5032   | 9082/5032   | 9082/5032   | 9082/5032   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-2-1 | storage-2-2 | storage-2-3 | storage-2-4 |
| 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   | 9083/5033   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| storage-3-1 | storage-3-2 | storage-3-3 | storage-3-4 |
| 9581/5531   | 9581/5531   | 9581/5531   | 9581/5531   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
```

Specially to avoid this, `genin` saves metadata and tree allocations in
`geninstate`. In fact, this is just a snapshot of how `genin` allocated
instances during `genin upgrade`, and therefore we can call `upgrade` as
many times as we want and always receive only consistent (and safe)
inventory changes.

Starting from version `0.5.0`, `genin` will create a `.geninstate`
 directory in the startup directory and save archives with the state
there. For example, a directory might look like this:
```shell
.geninstate
âââ 0b94d04e689d2a52048574903de899a36582a968a700095a019dc1097587054a.gz
âââ 14a3a6c82ec93b6a7e87bc09e086e42cdbca97c5ed158624054265e30036cbeb.gz
âââ 165582c99839c0dc3b6d918075128204da11116c5477f2cf839b608f06fddf11.gz
âââ 47e85eb6762cba402308430277a3061cffc39b0b2a6cdabb53ec4d8951d1cd3f.gz
âââ 92fe50ac32b1821d60aa41906500b8772360f005ebebb16efd405c513fd0e4bc.gz
âââ bf8e0e2339e13eff95c7f6acfb1668d15638ca03e1250726aa03f8e356841d37.gz
âââ latest.gz
```

The `state` filenames can be of two types. The first is the `latest`
state generated by the last successful run of `genin upgrade`. The
 second one is the **sha256** hashsum computed using
 `shasum256(shasum256 --old + shasum256 --new)`.

The contents of the states can be viewed with the help of the new `genin
list-state` command, which displays the last 10 runs of the `genin
upgrade` command. The output includes the operation type, the arguments
with which `genin` was called, as well as the list of changes (what has
been added and removed).

```shell
---
Upgrade: --from-latest-state --new tests/resources/cluster-new-v5.genin.yml -f
State file: .geninstate/latest.gz
Topology changes:
  + storage-3-1
  + storage-3-2
  + storage-4-1
  + storage-4-2
  - router-3
  - storage-1-3
  - storage-2-3
Hosts changes:
  - server-3
---
Upgrade: --from-latest-state --new tests/resources/cluster-new-v4.genin.yml -f
State file: .geninstate/14a3a6c82ec93b6a7e87bc09e086e42cdbca97c5ed158624054265e30036cbeb.gz
Topology changes:
  - storage-3-1
  - storage-3-2
  - storage-3-3
  - router-4
  - storage-1-4
  - storage-2-4
  - storage-3-4
Hosts changes:
  - server-4
```

To perform a `state`-based `upgrade` (based on a previous `upgrade`), you can:
- Provide the location of the state file for the `--old` argument.
  ```shell
  genin upgrade --old .geninstate/14a3a6c82ec93b6a7e87bc09e086e42cdbca97c5ed158624054265e30036cbeb.gz --new cluster-new-new.genin.yml
  ```
- Replace the `--old` argument with `--from-latest-state`.
  ```shell
  genin upgrade --from-latest-state --new cluster-new-new.genin.yml
  ```

Also, in some cases it may be convenient to save the entire `geninstate` somewhere in one
directory. This can be done with the `--state-dir` argument or by setting the `GENIN_STATE_DIR`
environment variable.

The `--export-state` argument can be useful for keeping the upgrade state under another name.

## Building from sources

At first, you need to clone the source code.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/picodata/genin.git
```

Second, you need to install Rust build tools.
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

---
> **Note:** You should refresh the `$PATH` variable to get access to the locally installed `rust binaries`.
---

After installing all required tools it is time to build and install `genin`.
```shell
cd genin
rustup override set nightly
cargo +nightly build --release
install -m 001 target/release/genin /usr/local/bin/
```

---
> **Note:** Do not forget to install build tools and dependencies before building `genin`.
>
> For Debian-based distributions:
> ```shell
> sudo apt install -y build-essential
> ```
> For Red Hat-based distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora):
> ```
> sudo yum install -y gcc
> ```
> For macOS make sure you have `Command Line Developer Tools` installed (`xcode-select --install`).
---

Check that the installation was successful:
